<h1>History</h1>

<table>
<tr>
  <td class='bold'>2010</td>
  <td>The foundation e-na’bel is established and the Board of Trustees has started its work. The AMIV publishing house donates its assets to the foundation e-na’bel and dissolves definitively.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class='bold'>2008</td>
  <td>The establishment of the foundation and the donation of the association's assets were decided and the initial Board of Trustees was elected.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class='bold'>2007</td>
  <td>The outsourcing of CDR and WBS is completed and the association now only manages its own assets.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class='bold'>2005</td>
  <td>The demand for the CDR service is declining sharply and the WBS is no longer able to cope with the restructuring at ETH and the volume. The association struggles against the prejudice of belonging to AMIV, which makes cooperation with all parties within VSETH difficult and sometimes impossible. In addition, the AMIV publishing house has no "official" status within ETH, as it neither belongs to VSETH nor is a partner organization of it. Therefore, the strategy is changed so that the CDR is integrated into the SoS, which already offers the processing of analog/digital media. In addition, the re-establishment of the WBS is prepared and this is integrated into VSETH. The goal of this divestment of all services is the donation of the association's assets to a foundation to be established, which will manage the money and return it to the student body in an appropriate form.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class='bold'>2000</td>
  <td>Since the calculation and planning for the publishing of books and scripts was very time-consuming and risky, a new service WBS (Web Based Services) was established, which offered study material for exam preparation. The publishing house thus relied on print-on-demand for the first time, which reduced costs for both students and the association.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class='bold'>90s</td>
  <td>The CDR (CD Recording) service was established, which enabled the creation of CDs and the digitization of analog media (film, sound).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class='bold'>70s</td>
  <td>Since the AMIV publishing house had accumulated a large fortune since its founding, the publishing house was no longer sustainable as a commission of AMIV and an independent association was founded, and the publishing activity was spun off from AMIV.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class='bold'>60s</td>
  <td>Establishment of the SAB by the AMIV publishing house to sell scripts.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class='bold'>1909</td>
  <td>The AMIV publishing house at ETH publishes its first script. The publishing house was responsible for printing lecture scripts.</td>
</tr>
